# Writes a release version into every place that carries it and prepends the new
# release to the readme.txt changelog.
#
# Called by @semantic-release/exec (prepareCmd) AFTER @semantic-release/changelog has
# added the new release to CHANGELOG.md and BEFORE @semantic-release/git commits.
# Every file changed here must be listed in .releaserc.json -> @semantic-release/git
# "assets", otherwise the change is made in the workspace but never reaches the git tag.
# release.yml catches that in "Verify workspace is the release commit", but that step runs
# AFTER the tag and the GitHub release were published: the job stops and the release has no
# ZIP. Recovery: fix the assets list, then run wporg-deploy.yml for that tag with upload-zip
# to attach the ZIP. If the missed file is readme.txt or the plugin file, the tag carries the
# old version and wporg-deploy.yml refuses it; the next release (a fix: commit) replaces it.
#
# Files changed: verify-phone-number-shift64.php (header Version + constant),
#                readme.txt (Stable tag + "= X.Y.Z =" changelog entry).
# Usage: ./scripts/update-version.sh <version>
# Works with GNU sed (ubuntu-latest) and BSD sed (macOS): -i always gets an attached suffix.
