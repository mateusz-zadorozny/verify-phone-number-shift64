Validates and formats billing and shipping phone numbers at WooCommerce checkout with libphonenumber. Does not send SMS or one-time codes.

== Description ==

Verify Phone Number Shift64 checks the phone numbers customers type at WooCommerce checkout. It rejects numbers that cannot exist in the customer's country and can rewrite valid numbers into one consistent format before they are saved on the order. All checks run on your own server with the rules of Google's open-source libphonenumber.

**It checks that a number is valid. It does not send SMS messages or one-time codes, and it does not confirm that the customer owns the number.**

= Features =

* Validates the billing and shipping phone numbers when the order is placed. Empty fields are not checked; whether a phone is required stays a WooCommerce setting.
* Works with both the block checkout (Store API) and the classic shortcode checkout.
* Reads numbers in the context of the address country, so `600 123 456` with a Polish address is understood as `+48 600 123 456`.
* Cleans up input first: spaces (including non-breaking spaces pasted from documents), hyphens, dots, slashes and parentheses are removed, and a leading `00` becomes `+`. Typographic dashes (–) are still rejected by WooCommerce's own phone check.
* Two validation modes: "Default country + international", or "International only" (every number must include its country prefix, typed with `+` or `00`).
* Three output formats: E.164 (`+48600123456`), international (`+48 600 123 456`) and national (`600 123 456`). Formatting on save can be switched off.
* Highlights the phone field that needs correcting (see Known issues).
* Compatible with High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) and the Cart and Checkout blocks.
* English and Polish error messages (see Known issues).
* Filters for developers.

Requires WooCommerce 7.2 or later, which itself needs WordPress 5.8 or later.

= What it does not do =

* It does not send SMS messages, one-time passwords or verification codes.
* It does not call the number or confirm that the customer owns it or can be reached on it.
* It does not look numbers up with carriers or any third-party service.
* It does not add a country flag picker or an input mask to the phone field.
* It does not check phone numbers outside the checkout, such as orders created or edited in the admin, or My Account addresses. Paying for an existing order through the Store API counts as checkout.

= Known issues =

In each case the customer still gets an error and the order is not placed until the number is corrected; only the extra help is missing.

* WordPress 6.7 and later: on non-English sites the block checkout shows the phone errors in English and does not highlight the field ([#32](https://github.com/mateusz-zadorozny/verify-phone-number-shift64/issues/32)).
* A classic checkout page next to a Checkout block page set as the WooCommerce checkout page: the classic page does not highlight the field ([#34](https://github.com/mateusz-zadorozny/verify-phone-number-shift64/issues/34)).

= Privacy =

The plugin makes no external HTTP requests and sends no data anywhere. Validation runs entirely on your server with rules bundled in the plugin. It sets no cookies and stores no personal data of its own, only its settings.

While validation is on, non-breaking and other Unicode spaces in a typed number become plain spaces. With "Enable Formatting on Save" on, the phone numbers of the order being placed are saved in the selected format; on the block checkout WooCommerce also copies them to the customer's account. Nothing else is changed.

= For developers =

Filters: `shift64_phone_validation_should_validate` (skip a field or an order), `shift64_phone_validation_formatted_phone` (change the stored value), `shift64_phone_validation_error_message` (reword messages) and `shift64_phone_validation_enqueue_assets` (turn off the highlighting scripts). The helper `Shift64\SmartPhoneValidation\format_phone()` formats a number for your own code and returns `null` when it is not valid. Signatures and examples: [developer documentation](https://github.com/mateusz-zadorozny/verify-phone-number-shift64#developers).

Formatting on save is on by default. Before going live, check every system that reads the order phone (exports, courier labels, SMS gateways): with E.164, `600 100 200` is stored as `+48600100200`.

= Third-party library =

Phone number rules come from [libphonenumber-for-php-lite](https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php-lite) by Joshua Gigg, a PHP port of Google's [libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) (Apache License 2.0), bundled with [symfony/polyfill-mbstring](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill-mbstring) (MIT). Neither connects to any external service. Apache 2.0 is compatible with GPLv3, so the plugin as a whole is distributed under the GPL through the "or later" clause.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate WooCommerce 7.2 or later.
2. In your WordPress admin go to Plugins > Add New Plugin, search for "Verify Phone Number Shift64", then click Install Now and Activate. Or download the ZIP file from this page and upload it under Plugins > Add New Plugin > Upload Plugin.
3. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Phone Validation. Validation and Formatting on Save are on by default, the fallback Default Country is Poland and the Output Format is E.164; adjust them to your store.
4. Try to place a test order with an invalid phone number to see the error.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it send SMS codes or verify that the customer owns the number? =

No. It only checks that the number is valid for the country and optionally reformats it. It sends no SMS or one-time codes and connects to no external service.

= Does it work with block checkout? =

Yes. Both the block checkout (Store API) and the classic `[woocommerce_checkout]` shortcode checkout are supported: the order is not placed until the phone number is corrected. See Known issues for setups where the field is not highlighted.

= Where are the settings? =

WooCommerce > Settings > Phone Validation.

= Which country is used for numbers without a prefix? =

The country of the billing or shipping address; "Default Country" is only a fallback for addresses without one. Numbers typed with "+" or "00" are always validated internationally. A number without a prefix is checked against the address country only, so `600 100 200` is valid next to a Polish or a German address but not a British one. Stores selling abroad should consider "International only".

= Is the shipping phone required? =

Not by this plugin. Whether the phone is required is a WooCommerce setting, and WooCommerce applies it to the shipping phone too. The plugin checks the shipping phone only when the customer fills it in, and on the classic checkout only when "Ship to a different address" is selected.

= Are phone numbers on existing orders changed? =

No. Only numbers submitted at checkout are checked and formatted. Deactivating or deleting the plugin does not touch saved orders.

= Can I change the error messages? =

Yes, with the `shift64_phone_validation_error_message` filter or by translating the `verify-phone-number-shift64` text domain.

= The plugin says its vendor folder is missing =

It was installed from a copy of the source code (such as a ZIP of the GitHub repository), which lacks the bundled `vendor` folder. Install it from WordPress.org instead.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Phone Validation tab under WooCommerce > Settings.
2. Classic checkout rejecting an invalid phone number, with the phone field highlighted.
3. Block checkout rejecting an invalid phone number.
4. A phone number stored in E.164 format on the order edit screen.
